        in high school and I have been hooked ever since. It was my sophmore year that I began to learn how to pass clubs. It was also around this time that I was introduced to the
        <a href="http://www.phillyjugglers.com/" target="_blank" class="props"
          >Philadelphia Jugglers Club</a
        >, which still exists today.

        Juggling is many things. It is an art and can take many forms and has many names, such as circus arts and flow arts. My flow art of choice is Poi.
         You may find me around town these days with
