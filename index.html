        I first started <span class="props">Juggling</span> my summer before
        high school, and I have been hooked ever since. Juggling is many things.
        It is a physical skill that involves the manipulation of objects. It is
        an art and can take many forms. I personally enjoy tossing clubs and
        spinning poi the most. recreation, entertainment, art or sport. The most
        recognizable form of juggling is toss juggling. Juggling can be the
        manipulation of one object or many objects at the same time, most often
        using one or two hands but also possible with feet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most
        common props are <span class="props">balls</span>,
        <span class="props">clubs</span>, or <span class="props">rings</span>.
        Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as
        <span class="props">knives</span>,
        <span class="props">fire torches</span> or
        <span class="props">chainsaws</span>. The term juggling can also
        commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills, such as diabolo,
        plate spinning, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, contact juggling,
        hooping, yo-yo, and hat manipulation.

      I was first introduced to the

      enhance my skills. Recently, I have been learning Poi and celebrating flow
      arts with the
