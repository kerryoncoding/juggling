        <strong>Juggling</strong> is a physical skill, performed by a juggler,
        involving the manipulation of objects for recreation, entertainment, art
        or sport. The most recognizable form of juggling is toss juggling.
        Juggling can be the manipulation of one object or many objects at the
        same time, most often using one or two hands but also possible with
        feet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most
        common props are <span class="props">balls</span>,
        <span class="props">clubs</span>, or <span class="props">rings</span>.
        Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as
        <span class="props">knives</span>,
        <span class="props">fire torches</span> or
        <span class="props">chainsaws</span>. The term juggling can also
        commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills, such as diabolo,
        plate spinning, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, contact juggling,
        hooping, yo-yo, and hat manipulation.

      I was first introduced to the
      <a href="http://www.phillyjugglers.com/" target="_blank"
        >Philadelphia Jugglers Club</a
      >
      when I was still in high school. To this day, I continue to develop and
      enhance my skills. Recently, I have been learning Poi and celebrating flow
      arts with the
      <a href="https://spinco.org/" target="_blank"
        >Philadelphia Spin Coalition</a
      >.
